# News Article Text Classification

This project performs supervised machine learning with text classification. Text classification is the process of assigning categories to text according to its content. It can be much easier to extract useful insights and information from text when it is organized into categories. But it can be extremely time consuming and costly to manually categorize text. Text classification can greatly speed this up by automating the process. More specifically, in this project we are performing Naive Bayes classifier on news articles based on the article's title.

The dataset contains over 120 thousand samples of news article titles. The data was gathered from over 2000 news sources by an academic news search engine. Each sample in the dataset is categorized into sports, business, world and science/technology.
